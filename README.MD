## ðŸ“– Abstract

Protein family classification remains challenging due to limitations in current k-mer approaches that ignore amino acids' biochemical properties. We present **PhysioChem-K-Mer**, a framework that transforms protein sequences into feature spaces based on physicochemical principles rather than sequence identity alone. Our method achieves **81.33% classification accuracy** (219.8% improvement over standard 3-mer methods) with **73.9% fewer features** and **71.2% faster training times**.
